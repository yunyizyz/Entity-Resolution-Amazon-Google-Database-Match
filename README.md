# Entity-Resolution-Amazon-Google-Database-Match
In this project, Entity Resolution (ER), Text Analytics, and Machine Learning techniques are used to optimize a product matching system between Google and Amazon product database.

## About Project
* Cleaned and tokenized text data, vectorized text data using TF-IDF;
* Leveraged Blocking algorithms to optimize the product match system between Google and Amazon database, achieved 99.96% Reduction Ratio compared to exhaustive matching pairs;
* Computed similarity between records in candidate pairs with various similarity metrics (Cosine similarity,  normalized Levenshtein similarity, etc.);
* Conducted Feature Engineering with the similarity metrics, developed Machine Learning models (Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict duplicates pairs (matching pairs).
